# Clojure React Native starter

This will automatically initialize a functioning React Native app using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)

The resulting app does NOT use expo, it's a pure react native app written in Clojure

## Dependencies

To run the script you'll need python and the requests library.
If you already have python installed, just run
```bash
pip install requests
```
You'll also need to setup your react native environment beforehand. Just follow [the guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Usage
Just execute the script like this: `python create-clojure-react-native.py`
It will walk you through everything else
